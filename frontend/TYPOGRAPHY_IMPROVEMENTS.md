- Icons have been scaled down proportionally to match new component sizes

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding responsive typography for different screen sizes
- Evaluate accessibility implications of smaller text sizes
- Monitor user feedback on the new compact design
- Consider adding theme variations for different density preferences
