# ðŸš€ Activities Page Enhanced with Structure Specifications

Your Nexus activities page has been significantly enhanced based on the `activity_management_structure.json` specifications! Here's what was implemented:

## âœ¨ **Structure-Based Enhancements**

### 1. **Enhanced Data Models (Based on JSON Structure)**

#### **User Entity**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
}
```

#### **Task Entity**
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  activity_id: string;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
  due_date: Date;
  assignee: User;
  depends_on?: Task;
  description?: string;
  priority?: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical";
  estimated_hours?: number;
  actual_hours?: number;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}
```

#### **Project Entity**
```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  status: "planning" | "active" | "on-hold" | "completed" | "cancelled";
  start_date: Date;
  end_date: Date;
  owner: User;
  team_members: User[];
}
```

#### **Production Reference Entity**
```typescript
interface ProductionReference {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: "batch" | "line" | "equipment" | "process";
  reference_id: string;
  description: string;
}
```

#### **Enhanced Activity Interface**
```typescript
interface Activity {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  start_date: Date;
  due_date: Date;
  status: "planned" | "in-progress" | "completed" | "cancelled" | "overdue" | "on-hold" | "pending-approval";
  priority: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical" | "urgent";
  owner: User;
  project?: Project;
  production_reference?: ProductionReference;
  tags: string[];
  attachments: Array<{...}>;
  type: "standalone" | "project-related" | "production-related";
  category?: string;
  cost?: number;
  risk_level?: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical";
  completion_criteria?: string[];
  milestones?: Array<{...}>;
  checklists?: Array<{...}>;
  time_logs?: Array<{...}>;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
  created_by: User;
  tasks: Task[];
}
```

### 2. **Layout Implementation (Based on JSON Structure)**

#### **Two-Column Layout**
- **Left Column**: List of activities with advanced filtering
- **Right Column**: Details of selected activity (view/add/edit/delete)
- **Right Sidebar**: Action buttons (Save, Edit, Delete, Cancel)

#### **Component Structure**
```typescript
// Based on JSON structure
frontend_components: {
  ActivityList: "Left column",
  ActivityDetails: "Right column",
  TaskList: "Inside ActivityDetails"
}
```

- **Advanced Search**: Search across titles, descriptions, owners

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **State Management**
```typescript
// Enhanced context with all entities
interface ActivitiesContextType {
  // State
  activities: Activity[];
  currentUser: User | null;
  projects: Project[];
  selectedProject: Project | null;

  // Task actions
  addTask: (activityId: string, task: Task) => void;
  updateTask: (activityId: string, taskId: string, updates: Partial<Task>) => void;
  deleteTask: (activityId: string, taskId: string) => void;
  toggleTaskCompletion: (activityId: string, taskId: string) => void;
