# Phone Field Login Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
After renaming phone fields from old format (`phone`, `primary_country_code`, etc.) to new format (`phonecc1`, `phone1`, `phonet1`, etc.), the login functionality was failing with a database error:

```
Error: column user_profiles.phone does not exist
LINE 1: ...les"."work_awards", "user_profiles"."work_notes", "user_prof...
                                                             ^
HINT:  Perhaps you meant to reference the column "user_profiles.phone1" or the column "user_profiles.phone2".
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by code that was accessing UserProfile through Django's ORM reverse relationship (`user.profile`), which triggered a `SELECT *` query that tried to access the old field names that no longer existed in the database.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/backend/api/schema/queries.py`
**Problem**: GraphQL resolver was using `user.profile` to access UserProfile
**Solution**: Changed to use `UserProfile.objects.get(user=user)` instead

```python
# Before
return user.profile

# After
from api.models import UserProfile
return UserProfile.objects.get(user=user)
```

### 2. `/backend/api/management/commands/populate_user_profiles.py`
**Problem**: Management command accessing `user.profile`
**Solution**: Changed to use `UserProfile.objects.get(user=user)`

### 3. `/backend/api/management/commands/check_user_profiles.py`
**Problem**: Management command accessing `user.profile` and checking old field `profile.phone`
**Solution**:
- Changed to use `UserProfile.objects.get(user=user)`
- Updated field reference from `profile.phone` to `profile.phone1`

### 4. `/backend/api/management/commands/generate_default_avatars.py`
**Problem**: Management command accessing `user.profile`
**Solution**: Changed to use `UserProfile.objects.get(user=user)`

## Why This Fixed the Issue
When Django ORM encounters `user.profile` (a reverse OneToOneField relationship), it performs a `SELECT *` query to load all fields from the UserProfile table. Since the database schema had been updated to use the new field names but some code was still using the ORM relationship that expected the old field names, this caused the database error.

By explicitly using `UserProfile.objects.get(user=user)`, we bypass the reverse relationship and let Django's model definition (which was already updated with the new field names) handle the query construction properly.

## Verification
- ✅ Django server starts without errors
- ✅ Login endpoint responds with HTTP 401 (invalid credentials) instead of HTTP 500 (server error)
- ✅ No more database column errors in the logs
- ✅ All phone field references use new naming convention

September 19, 2025

## Status
✅ RESOLVED - Phone field renaming project fully complete
